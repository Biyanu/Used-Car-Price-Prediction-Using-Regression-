# README: Used Cars Price Prediction (UAE)

## Project Overview
This project involves cleaning and analyzing a dataset of used cars from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to build a model for predicting car prices.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Address missing values.
   - Normalize numerical features.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Handle outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize key features (e.g., car make, model, year, mileage).
   - Analyze correlations with car prices.

3. **Model Development**
   - Train and test regression models.
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- **Car Make and Model**
- **Year**
- **Mileage**
- **Price** (target variable)

## Requirements
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.

## Outputs
- Cleaned dataset.
- Model evaluation metrics.
- Predicted car prices.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Follow the cells to clean, analyze, and model the data.
3. Use the cleaned dataset or prediction outputs for further analysis.
